# Assignment-5-Trivia-Game

I. Trivia Game
------------
1. I actually didn't have too much time to put into this assignment unfortunately as this was probably the busiest week I've had since the program started, so I apologize for the lack of style + efficiency on this assignment.
2. Everything works as intended, but there are some codes that I wish I had time to fix.
3. Nothing else to really say here, other than the fact that I feel the need to practice writing functions more and more and how to connect them together as I had some difficult time connecting all these functions to work together at the end of it all.
